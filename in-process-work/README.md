Privacy issues have been a big problem for the prevalent use of facial recognition system. Inspired by how people feel offensive by such technology, I decided to make three states of a cube that represent three states of our lives as the facial recognition system is out into more prevalent use. the first stage would be a closed cube, which represent the lives before any surveillance technology exsited. The second stage would be the half opened stage, which refers to our lives right now, where technologies like Facial Recognition System has been put into use but not yet prevalent. And there are behaviors that people do not want to be monitored written on within. The fianl stage would be a completely opened cube, which represent the future, where everyone would be under surveillance and there will be no privacy for each individual.
